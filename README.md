### üåé Cancer Genomics &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; üîç Structural Variants &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; üìà Long-Read Sequencing

**-----Insert introduction-----**

**Figure 1:** *Diagram of using a PDX model for short-read and long-read genomic samples. Prostate cancer tumor tissue was collected from a patient, and tumor tissue material was increased in mouse models before sequencing. Note: short-read and long-read samples were collected from different mice.*

**Research Question:** *How do genomic rearrangements compare between short-read and long-read sequencing data in prostate cancer genomes?*

## Bioinformatics Pipelines

```
# Short-read structural variant calling tools.
/Call_Variants/svaba/svaba.sh
/Call_Variants/gridss/gridss.sh # Not used for comparison.
```

**Figure 2:** *Brief pipeline describing how structural variants were called for short-read sequencing data. The red box identifies the normal (i.e., non-tumor) sample that was used to remove germline variants. Italicized text at the top of each box indicates the program used to complete the task.*
